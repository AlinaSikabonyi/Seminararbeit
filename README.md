## ðŸ§  Implementation Summary

This repository contains a computational model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis.  
The model explores the mathematical foundations of thyroid regulation through differential equations and feedback theory.

### Key Technical Contributions
- Reproduced a dynamic ODE model of the HPT axis using Python (`NumPy`, `SciPy`, `Matplotlib`).
- Implemented numerical simulations with the Rungeâ€“Kutta solver (`solve_ivp`).
- Analyzed multiple theoretical frameworks â€” Set-Point, Maximum Curvature, and Gain Factor.
- Produced comparative plots and stability analyses for model validation.
